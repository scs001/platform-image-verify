// ── Mediated connector access (add-served-agent-connector-access D2/D9) ─────
//
// A served (facade) agent is used by people who are not its deployer, so the
// deployment token a static MCP row would inject authenticates the WRONG
// person. This module is the replacement path: the agent names a binding and a
// tool, the platform decides who is on the other end at THIS turn, and the
// connector is called as that person.
//
// The four-way decision is the whole point, and each arm is a different answer:
//
//   scope absent            → no visitor (A2A caller / background turn)
//                             run as the deployer, and say so
//   scope anonymous         → the facade said this visitor has no identity
//                             run as the deployer, and say so
//   scope registered+actor  → run as the actor (OBO)
//   scope unregistered      → the registration channel is broken
//                             FAIL CLOSED: no call, no fallback
//
// That last arm is why the module has the shape it has. Falling back there
// would turn "the link is down" into "the deployer did it", which is precisely
// the false success this change set out to remove.
//
// Before an actor call the platform asks the connector's read-only preflight
// (`GET /api/tenant/service-whoami`) why the identity would be refused, if it
// would, so a refusal reaches the visitor as "sign in once" or "ask ops to
// enable the tier" instead of a bare 401 to guess at.
//
// Deliberately NOT done here: minting, revoking, or registering an identity.
// An unknown actor stays unknown — automatic provisioning would move the
// authority for "who is this person" off the connector's OIDC login.
