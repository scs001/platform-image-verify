## Requirements

### Requirement: Backend API for managing MCP servers at runtime

The server SHALL expose REST API endpoints to list, add, remove, enable, and disable MCP servers without requiring a server restart. Each listed server SHALL include its `origin` (`bundled` or `user`) and `locked` flag. Servers marked `locked` (packager-locked bundled entries) SHALL NOT be removable, disable-able, or config-editable via the API: such requests SHALL return 400 with an explanatory error. Authorization for these mutation endpoints SHALL be deployment-shaped: in a shared deployment (multiple identities against one runtime) mutations SHALL require the existing administrator group authorization — optional SSO identity alone SHALL NOT satisfy it; in a per-user hosted cell the single owning user SHALL be authorized to mutate MCP servers in their own cell without holding the administrator group, because their cell's configuration store is theirs alone. Mutations SHALL modify the cell's (or deployment's global) MCP configuration store, while personal availability toggles SHALL use the separate identity-scoped binding endpoints and SHALL NOT modify this store. `credentialRef` is a system-managed marker: a client-submitted server config (add or update) that carries a `credentialRef` field SHALL be rejected with 400 and an explanatory error, and SHALL NOT be persisted; the marker may only be stamped by the platform (market-catalog installs of credential-origin servers) or declared in the operator-level `mcp.json`.

#### Scenario: list MCP servers via API

- **WHEN** client sends GET `/api/extensions/mcp`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return a list of all configured MCP servers with their name, config, status (connected/disconnected), enabled state, tool count, origin, and locked flag

#### Scenario: add MCP server via API

- **WHEN** an authorized requester (administrator in a shared deployment, or the cell owner in a per-user cell) sends POST `/api/extensions/mcp` with server config (name, command/args or url, headers, env)
- **THEN** the server SHALL persist the config (with `origin: "user"`), connect to the server, register its tools, and return success

#### Scenario: client-submitted credentialRef is rejected

- **WHEN** an authorized requester submits a server config (add or update) whose body carries a `credentialRef` field
- **THEN** the server SHALL return 400 explaining that `credentialRef` is system-managed
- **AND** no configuration row SHALL be created or modified

#### Scenario: non-admin cannot mutate global MCP configuration

- **WHEN** authentication is enabled in a shared deployment (no cell owner) and a non-admin user sends a global MCP mutation
- **THEN** the server returns `403`
- **AND** the global configuration remains unchanged

#### Scenario: cell owner manages MCP in their own cell

- **WHEN** a hosted per-user cell is serving its owning user, who does not belong to the administrator group, and the owner sends POST/PATCH/DELETE `/api/extensions/mcp...`
- **THEN** the mutation SHALL be authorized and behave exactly as an administrator's mutation in a shared deployment

#### Scenario: remove MCP server via API

- **WHEN** an authorized requester sends DELETE `/api/extensions/mcp/:name`
- **THEN** the server SHALL disconnect from the server, unregister its tools, remove the config, and return success
- **WHEN** the named server is locked
- **THEN** the server SHALL return 400 and leave the entry untouched

#### Scenario: enable/disable MCP server via API

- **WHEN** an authorized requester sends PATCH `/api/extensions/mcp/:name` with `{ "enabled": false }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL disconnect from the server, unregister its tools, mark it disabled, and return success
- **WHEN** an authorized requester sends PATCH `/api/extensions/mcp/:name` with `{ "enabled": true }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL connect to the server, register its tools, mark it enabled, and return success
- **WHEN** the named server is locked
- **THEN** enable/disable and config-update requests SHALL return 400 and leave the entry untouched

### Requirement: Backend API for managing skills at runtime
The server SHALL expose REST API endpoints to list, add, remove, enable, and disable skills without requiring a server restart. Each listed skill SHALL include its `origin` and `locked` flag. Locked bundled skills SHALL NOT be removable, disable-able, or editable via the API: such requests SHALL return 400.

#### Scenario: list skills via API
- **WHEN** client sends GET `/api/extensions/skills`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return a list of all skills with their name, description, source (built-in/custom/bundled), enabled state, origin, and locked flag

#### Scenario: add custom skill via API
- **WHEN** client sends POST `/api/extensions/skills` with skill definition (name, description, body)
- **THEN** the server SHALL persist the skill (with `origin: "user"`), register it with the agent, and return success

#### Scenario: remove custom skill via API
- **WHEN** client sends DELETE `/api/extensions/skills/:name`
- **THEN** the server SHALL unregister the skill, remove its definition, and return success
- **AND** built-in skills SHALL NOT be removable (return 400)
- **AND** locked bundled skills SHALL NOT be removable (return 400)

#### Scenario: enable/disable skill via API
- **WHEN** client sends PATCH `/api/extensions/skills/:name` with `{ "enabled": false }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL unregister the skill from the agent, mark it disabled, and return success
- **WHEN** client sends PATCH `/api/extensions/skills/:name` with `{ "enabled": true }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL register the skill with the agent, mark it enabled, and return success
- **WHEN** the named skill is locked
- **THEN** enable/disable requests SHALL return 400 and leave the entry untouched

### Requirement: Extension records carry origin, lock, and permission metadata
The extensions store SHALL persist for every MCP server and skill record: `origin` (`bundled` | `user`, defaulting to `user` for existing and newly added records), `locked` (default false), `permissions` (nullable JSON holding `allow`/`deny` tool globs), and `requiredGroups` (nullable JSON array of group names, stamped from the market entry's groups at gated-install time; null for ungated installs and all pre-existing rows). Existing rows SHALL migrate to these defaults losslessly. Permission enforcement is a separate capability; this requirement covers storage and API exposure only.

#### Scenario: existing records migrate to user origin
- **WHEN** the server starts against a DB created before origin/locked/permissions/requiredGroups existed
- **THEN** every existing record reports `origin: "user"`, `locked: false`, null permissions, and null requiredGroups
- **AND** all prior behaviors (list/add/remove/enable/disable) work unchanged

#### Scenario: bundled records expose their metadata
- **WHEN** a bundled MCP server with `locked: true` and permissions is seeded
- **THEN** GET `/api/extensions/mcp` includes its origin, locked flag, and permissions payload

#### Scenario: gated install exposes requiredGroups
- **WHEN** an MCP record was installed from a market entry carrying groups `["mcp-jira-users"]`
- **THEN** GET `/api/extensions/mcp` includes `requiredGroups: ["mcp-jira-users"]` for that record

### Requirement: Hot-reload MCP connections on config change

The server SHALL support connecting to new MCP servers and disconnecting from existing ones at runtime, updating the agent's available tools without restarting. Global add/remove/enable/disable mutations SHALL update the global configuration and trigger the normal hot-reload path. A personal MCP availability binding SHALL update only the effective runtime overlay when applied; it SHALL use the same serialized hot-reload path but SHALL NOT alter the global configuration or its enabled flag.

#### Scenario: new MCP server connected at runtime
- **WHEN** an MCP server is added via API
- **THEN** the server SHALL establish a connection, discover its tools, register them as `ToolDefinition`s, and update the agent's tool allowlist
- **AND** broadcast an `extensions_changed` WebSocket event to all clients

#### Scenario: MCP server disconnected at runtime
- **WHEN** an MCP server is removed or disabled via API
- **THEN** the server SHALL close the connection, unregister its tools from the agent's tool allowlist
- **AND** broadcast an `extensions_changed` WebSocket event to all clients

#### Scenario: personal MCP availability reloads without global mutation
- **WHEN** an authenticated user's effective MCP overlay changes while the runtime is idle
- **THEN** the runtime hot-reloads the effective tool set
- **AND** `GET /api/extensions/mcp` still reports the unchanged global enabled state

### Requirement: Hot-reload skill registrations on config change
The server SHALL support registering and unregistering skills at runtime, updating the agent's available skills without restarting.

#### Scenario: new skill registered at runtime
- **WHEN** a skill is added or enabled via API
- **THEN** the server SHALL load the skill into the agent's skill registry
- **AND** broadcast an `extensions_changed` WebSocket event to all clients

#### Scenario: skill unregistered at runtime
- **WHEN** a skill is removed or disabled via API
- **THEN** the server SHALL remove the skill from the agent's skill registry
- **AND** broadcast an `extensions_changed` WebSocket event to all clients

### Requirement: MCP and skill configs persist across restarts
The server SHALL persist MCP server configurations and custom skill definitions so they survive server restarts.

#### Scenario: MCP server config persistss
- **WHEN** an MCP server is added via API and the server restarts
- **THEN** the server SHALL reconnect to that MCP server on startup

#### Scenario: custom skill persists
- **WHEN** a custom skill is added via API and the server restarts
- **THEN** the server SHALL reload that skill on startup

### Requirement: Personal MCP availability is a separate management operation

The server SHALL expose an authenticated personal MCP availability endpoint that accepts an existing global MCP name and a boolean enabled value. The endpoint SHALL persist an email-keyed overlay, reject unknown names and attempts to disable locked servers, and apply the resulting effective profile through the shared runtime coordinator. The endpoint SHALL never expose or persist MCP URLs, headers, credentials, permissions, or complete configurations.

#### Scenario: personal toggle is authorized
- **WHEN** an authenticated user toggles an existing non-locked MCP server
- **THEN** the personal overlay is saved
- **AND** the global MCP record is unchanged

#### Scenario: personal toggle is rejected for a locked server
- **WHEN** an authenticated user attempts to disable a locked MCP server
- **THEN** the server returns an error
- **AND** the server remains enabled in the effective profile
