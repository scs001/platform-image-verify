## Purpose

Defines the in-cell scheduled-task engine: creating, persisting, and firing prompt jobs bound to a specific agent preset and session, with timezone-aware schedules and deterministic behavior around busy turns, runtime restarts, and downtime.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Job scheduling API
The system SHALL support creating one-shot tasks (run once at a specific time) and recurring tasks (run on a cron schedule) — tasks whose trigger is a schedule — each with a prompt and its target-persona/session binding carried by the task. Management operations — list, remove, pause, resume, and run-now — SHALL remain available over the existing cell WebSocket surface using the existing `cron_*` message and event types, operating on tasks with schedule triggers.

#### Scenario: Create a recurring job
- **WHEN** a client sends a job-create request with a cron expression and a prompt
- **THEN** the system SHALL create a task with a schedule trigger and broadcast its status with an identifier, schedule, and next-run time

#### Scenario: Create a one-shot job
- **WHEN** a client sends a job-create request with an absolute time and a prompt
- **THEN** the system SHALL create a task scheduled to run once at that time

#### Scenario: Pause and resume
- **WHEN** a task with a schedule trigger is paused
- **THEN** its schedule SHALL stop firing until it is resumed
- **AND** on resume a recurring task SHALL continue from the next future occurrence

#### Scenario: Run now
- **WHEN** a run-now request is sent for a task
- **THEN** the task SHALL execute once immediately regardless of its schedule, without affecting future scheduled occurrences

### Requirement: Jobs persist across restarts
All tasks with schedule triggers SHALL be persisted atomically with the engine's task records and restored when the cell starts, with recurring schedules rescheduled automatically; execution-level restart semantics (queued resumes, running becomes interrupted) are the engine's.

#### Scenario: Restore after restart
- **WHEN** the cell starts and persisted schedule-triggered tasks exist
- **THEN** enabled recurring schedules SHALL be rescheduled
- **AND** one-shot schedules whose time has not passed SHALL remain scheduled

#### Scenario: Atomic persistence
- **WHEN** a task or schedule mutation is persisted
- **THEN** the storage write SHALL be atomic, such that a crash mid-write cannot corrupt previously stored tasks

### Requirement: Schedules are timezone-aware
A job MAY carry an IANA timezone identifier. When present, its cron schedule SHALL be evaluated in that timezone. When absent, the schedule SHALL be evaluated in the cell's local timezone.

#### Scenario: User timezone applies
- **WHEN** a job is created with cron `0 9 * * *` and timezone `Asia/Shanghai` on a cell running in UTC
- **THEN** the job SHALL fire at 09:00 Asia/Shanghai time

#### Scenario: Legacy job falls back to cell timezone
- **WHEN** a persisted job carries no timezone
- **THEN** its schedule SHALL be evaluated in the cell's local timezone, matching pre-change behavior

### Requirement: Downtime and expiry lifecycle
Recurring schedules whose occurrences passed entirely while the runtime was down SHALL NOT catch up; the gap SHALL be recorded on the task as a missed marker. One-shot schedules whose time passed while down SHALL mark their task expired at load.

#### Scenario: Missed occurrences are not replayed
- **WHEN** a daily task's cell was down across one scheduled occurrence and starts afterwards
- **THEN** the missed occurrence SHALL NOT execute
- **AND** the task SHALL record a missed marker for it
- **AND** future occurrences SHALL fire normally

#### Scenario: One-shot expired during downtime
- **WHEN** the cell starts and a one-shot task's time is in the past
- **THEN** the task SHALL be marked expired without executing
