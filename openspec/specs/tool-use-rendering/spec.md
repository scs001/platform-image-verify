# tool-use-rendering Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-mcp-skills-model-select. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Server forwards tool input and output in tool events
The server SHALL include the tool's input arguments in `tool_start` events and the tool's result and error status in `tool_end` events, using the `args` and `result` fields already provided by the SDK's tool execution events.

#### Scenario: tool start includes input
- **WHEN** the agent begins executing a tool `bash` with arguments `{ "command": "ls" }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL send `{ "type": "tool_start", "name": "bash", "args": { "command": "ls" } }`

#### Scenario: tool end includes output
- **WHEN** the tool finishes and produces a result
- **THEN** the server SHALL send `{ "type": "tool_end", "name": "bash", "result": "<output>", "isError": false }`

#### Scenario: tool end includes error
- **WHEN** the tool finishes with an error
- **THEN** the server SHALL send `{ "type": "tool_end", "name": "bash", "result": "<error output>", "isError": true }`

### Requirement: UI renders tool calls as collapsible blocks
The chat UI SHALL render each tool call as a collapsible block with the tool name in its header and the input and output in its body, replacing the previous one-line tool indicator. A `todo_write` call is the exception: because its whole-list snapshot is rendered as the plan surface (see `chat-plan-progress`), its block SHALL render as a single compact summary line naming the tool and the resulting counts (e.g. `更新了计划（3/6）`, localized), with the full arguments available only through the block's expand path. No other tool loses the generic block.

#### Scenario: tool call block shown while running
- **WHEN** the server sends a `tool_start` event for tool `bash`
- **THEN** the UI SHALL render a collapsible block with header indicating `bash` and a running state
- **AND** the body SHALL display the tool's input arguments

#### Scenario: tool call block updated on completion
- **WHEN** the server sends the matching `tool_end` event
- **THEN** the UI SHALL update the block to a completed state and append the tool's output to the body

#### Scenario: tool block is collapsible
- **WHEN** the user clicks the block header
- **THEN** the body SHALL toggle between collapsed and expanded

#### Scenario: todo_write renders as a summary line
- **WHEN** the assistant calls `todo_write` with a 6-item list of which 3 are completed
- **THEN** the transcript SHALL render one compact line naming the tool and the `3/6` counts instead of the generic block with raw JSON arguments
- **AND** the plan surface SHALL show the same list

### Requirement: UI renders tool errors with distinct styling
The chat UI SHALL visually distinguish tool calls that ended in error from successful ones.

#### Scenario: errored tool call displayed
- **WHEN** a `tool_end` event arrives with `isError: true`
- **THEN** the block SHALL be styled with the error appearance and the body SHALL show the error output

### Requirement: Tool output blocks are scroll-bounded
The chat UI SHALL constrain the height of a tool block's body so that large outputs do not dominate the conversation, while remaining scrollable.

#### Scenario: large tool output
- **WHEN** a tool produces output exceeding the body's maximum height
- **THEN** the body SHALL scroll within a bounded max-height rather than expanding the whole block


### Requirement: Subagent failure cards carry the child turn's real end reason

When a delegated subagent's turn ends in error, the subagent tool failure card SHALL surface that turn's actual end reason — the error message and machine-readable error code from the child session — instead of a bare generic failure label. Rendering SHALL degrade gracefully when no end-reason detail exists (legacy sessions): the card falls back to the generic label.

#### Scenario: gateway rate-limit failure is legible
- **WHEN** a subagent turn ends with a concurrency-limit rejection from the gateway
- **THEN** the failure card SHALL show the rejection message and its error code
- **AND** the card SHALL NOT show only the generic "subagent run failed" label

#### Scenario: legacy session without end-reason detail
- **WHEN** a failed subagent run has no recorded end-reason detail
- **THEN** the failure card SHALL render the generic failure label as before
