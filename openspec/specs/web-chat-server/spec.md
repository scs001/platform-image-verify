## Requirements

### Requirement: Server creates and manages a dsh agent session

The server SHALL create a single agent session on startup by spawning the dsh runtime as a subprocess and establishing a JSON-RPC session over stdio (see `dsh-runtime-bridge`). The session SHALL be in-memory and equipped with the dsh-profile tools (`dsh-tool-bash`, `dsh-tool-fs`, `dsh-mcp-client`). When no chat provider is configured, the server SHALL still spawn the runtime and start successfully (chat non-functional, logged) rather than exiting — see "Server degrades gracefully when no chat provider is configured". The single shared session SHALL have one effective runtime profile composed from global configuration and, when applied, an authenticated user's personal model and MCP availability bindings. The profile coordinator SHALL not preempt an in-flight response; it SHALL retain a different requested profile as pending until the runtime is idle.

#### Scenario: Server starts successfully
- **WHEN** the server starts with a valid API key configured and the dsh binary discoverable
- **THEN** the dsh runtime SHALL be spawned with a profile composing bash, fs, grep, find, ls, and MCP tools and an in-memory session

#### Scenario: User sends a prompt
- **WHEN** a WebSocket client sends `{ "type": "prompt", "text": "List files" }`
- **THEN** the server forwards the prompt to the dsh runtime via JSON-RPC and streams the translated response back

#### Scenario: User sends prompt while agent is streaming
- **WHEN** a WebSocket client sends a prompt while the agent is already processing
- **THEN** the server SHALL queue the prompt using `steer` behavior or reject it, preserving the existing streaming guard

#### Scenario: Personal profile waits for an in-flight response
- **WHEN** an authenticated user requests a different effective runtime profile while a prompt is streaming
- **THEN** the response continues to completion
- **AND** the requested profile is retained as pending
- **AND** the profile is applied only after the runtime becomes idle

### Requirement: Server accepts user prompts via WebSocket
The server SHALL accept JSON messages of type `prompt` over WebSocket and forward them to the dsh agent session. The server SHALL track, per connection, the session that connection's client is viewing, and a prompt received from a connection SHALL be recorded into that connection's viewed session (`session-ownership`); the shared runtime still executes one turn at a time.

#### Scenario: User sends a prompt
- **WHEN** a WebSocket client sends `{ "type": "prompt", "text": "List files" }`
- **THEN** the server calls `session.prompt("List files")` and streams the response back
- **AND** the user message is recorded into the session that client is viewing

#### Scenario: User sends prompt while agent is streaming
- **WHEN** a WebSocket client sends a prompt while the agent is already processing
- **THEN** the server SHALL queue the prompt using `steer` behavior

#### Scenario: Two users viewing different sessions
- **WHEN** two connections view different sessions and the second sends a prompt
- **THEN** that prompt's user message and reply are recorded into the second connection's viewed session
- **AND** the first connection's viewed session transcript is unchanged

### Requirement: Server streams agent text responses
The server SHALL subscribe to dsh session notifications and translate assistant text-delta notifications into `text_delta`-equivalent WebSocket messages to the client.

#### Scenario: Agent generates text
- **WHEN** the dsh runtime emits an assistant text-delta notification
- **THEN** the server SHALL broadcast `{ "type": "text", "delta": "<partial text>" }` for each delta

#### Scenario: Agent finishes responding
- **WHEN** the dsh runtime signals turn completion
- **THEN** the server SHALL broadcast `{ "type": "done" }`

### Requirement: Server streams tool execution events
The server SHALL translate dsh `tool/*` lifecycle notifications into `tool_execution_start`/`tool_execution_end`-equivalent WebSocket events.

#### Scenario: Agent runs a tool
- **WHEN** the dsh runtime emits a tool-start notification
- **THEN** the server SHALL broadcast `{ "type": "tool_start", "name": "<tool name>" }`
- **AND** on the tool-end notification, broadcast `{ "type": "tool_end", "name": "<tool name>", "isError": <boolean> }`

### Requirement: Server serves static frontend files
The server SHALL serve the `web/dist/` directory (SPA, built by Vite) as static files at the root path with a SPA fallback for deep links, with HTTP compression enabled for compressible static assets.

#### Scenario: Browser requests the page
- **WHEN** a browser navigates to `http://localhost:3000`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return the React SPA entry `web/dist/index.html`

#### Scenario: compressible asset is requested
- **WHEN** a client requests a large text-based asset (e.g. the app entry chunk) with `Accept-Encoding` allowing gzip/br
- **THEN** the server SHALL return the asset content-compressed rather than uncompressed

### Requirement: Server degrades gracefully when no chat provider is configured
The server SHALL start successfully when no chat provider is configured. When `VOLCES_API_KEY` is unset, the Volces llm adapter SHALL NOT be loaded into the dsh profile, the dsh profile SHALL load no llm adapters, the runtime SHALL still be spawned, and the server SHALL log a warning that chat is non-functional. The documents RAG SHALL log a warning when it initializes without a Volces key.

#### Scenario: server starts with no chat provider
- **WHEN** the server starts with `VOLCES_API_KEY` unset
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT exit
- **AND** SHALL log a warning that no chat provider is configured
- **AND** the dsh runtime SHALL be spawned with no llm adapter in the profile

#### Scenario: documents RAG warns when no Volces key
- **WHEN** the documents store initializes with `VOLCES_API_KEY` unset
- **THEN** the documents module SHALL log a warning that indexing/query calls will fail at call time

### Requirement: No secrets are baked into source
The server SHALL NOT ship a functional API key as a fallback default in source. Provider API keys SHALL be read from environment variables (or, in the packaged app, from `settings.json`); an unset key SHALL resolve to `undefined`, never to a baked-in credential. The `VOLCES_API_KEY` line SHALL use optional chaining (`process.env.VOLCES_API_KEY?.trim()`), and provider registration SHALL be gated on a `volcesEnabled` boolean derived from the resolved key.

#### Scenario: unset key resolves to undefined
- **WHEN** `VOLCES_API_KEY` is unset in the environment
- **THEN** the resolved key SHALL be `undefined`
- **AND** no fallback credential SHALL be substituted from source
- **AND** the Volces provider SHALL NOT be registered

### Requirement: Asynchronous errors are surfaced, not leaked as unhandled rejections
Every asynchronous WebSocket message handler SHALL catch its own promise rejections and emit an `{ type: "error", message }` message to the originating client rather than leaking an unhandled promise rejection. The cron mutation handlers (`cron_remove`, `cron_pause`, `cron_resume`, `cron_run`) SHALL each wrap their async work in `try/catch`, mirroring `cron_add`. The connect-time `workdirStore.getWorkdir()` promise SHALL have a rejection handler that logs. The `shutdown()` path SHALL wrap the `closeMcpClients` await in `try/catch` so a rejection does not prevent `process.exit(0)`. The reverse-proxy response reads in `createWebProxy` SHALL wrap `await upstreamRes.arrayBuffer()` in `try/catch` and return HTTP 502 on failure.

#### Scenario: a cron handler error is surfaced to the client
- **WHEN** a `cron_remove`, `cron_pause`, `cron_resume`, or `cron_run` handler throws
- **THEN** the server SHALL emit `{ type: "error", message }` to the originating WebSocket client
- **AND** SHALL NOT leak an unhandled promise rejection

#### Scenario: shutdown completes despite closeMcpClients failure
- **WHEN** `closeMcpClients` rejects during shutdown
- **THEN** the server SHALL log the error and SHALL still exit

#### Scenario: proxy response-read failure returns 502
- **WHEN** `await upstreamRes.arrayBuffer()` rejects in `createWebProxy`
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond with HTTP 502 and a message describing the read failure

### Requirement: Server decomposition preserves the external contract
The backend SHALL remain launchable via `node server.js` with the same HTTP route surface (paths, methods, status codes), the same WebSocket message protocol, the same middleware ordering semantics (forward-auth gate before handlers, static + SPA fallback registered last), and the same boot/initialization ordering as the pre-decomposition monolith. Internal code organization into `server/` modules SHALL NOT introduce observable behavior changes.

#### Scenario: e2e suite passes unchanged after extraction
- **WHEN** the full offline e2e `fast` project runs against the decomposed server
- **THEN** all tests that passed pre-decomposition SHALL pass post-decomposition without modification to specs or the frontend

#### Scenario: entrypoint and middleware order are stable
- **WHEN** the server starts via `node server.js` (dev) or the supervisor/packaged launcher
- **THEN** static assets and SPA fallback SHALL remain served after all `/api` routes
- **AND** WebSocket upgrades SHALL pass through the same identity gate as HTTP requests when forward-auth is enabled

#### Scenario: boot initialization ordering is preserved
- **WHEN** the server initializes (db, documents store, dsh agent, legacy migrations, catalog, cron)
- **THEN** initialization SHALL occur in the same relative order as before decomposition, in particular documents-store init before legacy migrations run

### Requirement: Server listens before background initialization completes
The server SHALL accept TCP connections and serve static files and non-agent endpoints within ~1 second of process start, before dsh agent startup, legacy migrations, catalog loading, and cron initialization complete. Initialization groups with no ordering dependency SHALL run concurrently. Endpoints and WebSocket commands that require the dsh agent SHALL respond with an explicit initializing error (HTTP 503 / WS error event) until the agent is ready, and clients SHALL be notified when it becomes ready.

#### Scenario: static assets answer during cold start
- **WHEN** the server process has just started and the dsh agent is still handshaking
- **THEN** an HTTP request for the SPA entry SHALL succeed without waiting for agent readiness

#### Scenario: chat command during initialization
- **WHEN** a client sends a `prompt` WebSocket command before the dsh agent is ready
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond with an initializing error instead of crashing or hanging
- **AND** the server SHALL emit a readiness event to connected clients once the agent is available

#### Scenario: catalog cloud fetch does not block readiness
- **WHEN** the remote agents catalog URL is slow or unreachable (up to its 10s timeout)
- **THEN** the server SHALL already be listening and serving the local catalog
- **AND** cloud catalog entries SHALL merge in when the fetch completes

### Requirement: Shared runtime profile changes are synchronized over WebSocket

The server SHALL expose WebSocket events that distinguish the active shared runtime profile from an identity's private binding state. `runtime_binding` SHALL be broadcast after a successful profile application; `runtime_binding_pending` SHALL be broadcast when a requested profile cannot be applied immediately. These events SHALL include the effective model and MCP availability state needed by the UI but SHALL NOT include an email. A socket with a trusted identity SHALL additionally receive its own `user_bindings` snapshot. Anonymous sockets SHALL receive global runtime state without a personal snapshot.

#### Scenario: clients observe an applied profile
- **WHEN** a personal profile is applied to the shared runtime
- **THEN** all connected clients receive `runtime_binding` with the effective model and MCP availability

#### Scenario: clients observe a deferred profile
- **WHEN** a personal profile is requested while the runtime is busy
- **THEN** clients receive `runtime_binding_pending`
- **AND** the event does not contain the requesting user's email

#### Scenario: authenticated client receives private state
- **WHEN** an authenticated client connects
- **THEN** it receives its own `user_bindings` snapshot in addition to global runtime state

### Requirement: Pending asks are held per session and restored on reconnect

The server SHALL hold at most one pending ask per dsh session, broadcast the question batch to that session's viewers when it arrives, and re-push the pending question during connection sync and session load so a reload or reconnect restores the card. The pending state SHALL be cleared when the ask is answered, cancelled, or failed.

#### Scenario: ask is broadcast to viewers

- **WHEN** an ask arrives for the session a client is viewing
- **THEN** the client receives the question batch associated with that session

#### Scenario: reload restores a pending card

- **WHEN** a client reloads or reconnects while an ask is still pending in the viewed session
- **THEN** the connection sync delivers the pending question so the card renders again

#### Scenario: resolution clears the pending state

- **WHEN** a pending ask is answered, cancelled, or failed
- **THEN** the per-session pending state is cleared and subsequent syncs deliver no pending question

### Requirement: Answer submissions are ownership-checked and first-wins

The server SHALL accept an answer or cancellation for a pending ask only from clients viewing the owning session. The first accepted submission SHALL resolve the ask; later submissions for the same ask SHALL have no effect on the outcome. Every viewer SHALL observe the final resolved state.

#### Scenario: an owning viewer answers

- **WHEN** a client viewing the session submits an answer for the pending ask
- **THEN** the answer is forwarded to the runtime and resolves the ask

#### Scenario: a late second submission is a no-op

- **WHEN** another surface already resolved the pending ask
- **THEN** the later submission changes nothing and the client's card converges to the final answered state

#### Scenario: a foreign client is rejected

- **WHEN** a client not viewing the owning session submits an answer
- **THEN** the submission is rejected without affecting the ask

### Requirement: Bot-session asks never reach the web transcript

An ask originating in a bot session SHALL be routed to that session's registered collector and SHALL NOT be broadcast to web viewers or stored as web-session pending state.

#### Scenario: bot ask stays in its channel

- **WHEN** an ask arrives for a bot session id
- **THEN** no web client receives a question event and no web pending state is created
