# tenant-cell-runtime Specification

## Purpose

Defines the per-user isolation unit ("cell") of the hosted multi-user deployment: one platform server process with its own dsh runtime and per-user data directory, such that no user's data, configuration, or agent activity is observable or reachable from another user's cell.

## Requirements

### Requirement: A cell encapsulates one user's complete runtime state
The hosted deployment SHALL serve each user from a dedicated cell consisting of one platform server process, its interactive dsh agent runtime, an optional bounded pool of task-worker runtimes (see `worker-pool`), and a per-user data directory. All per-user mutable state — chat history, sessions, document library and search index, extension and MCP configuration, custom skills, preferences, cron jobs, tasks, and bots — SHALL be stored under that user's data directory and SHALL NOT be readable or writable from any other user's cell. Worker runtimes share the cell's composed profile and their state stays under the same data directory. Shared read-only inputs (application code, model gateway credentials) MAY be provided identically to every cell.

#### Scenario: two users' data are isolated
- **WHEN** users A and B each upload documents and hold chat sessions on the hosted deployment
- **THEN** user A's document library, chat history, and session list contain none of user B's items
- **AND** no API, tool call, or MCP tool available to user A can read user B's data

#### Scenario: per-user MCP and skills sets
- **WHEN** user A enables an MCP server or installs a custom skill in their cell
- **THEN** the change affects user A's cell only
- **AND** user B's available MCP servers and skills are unchanged

#### Scenario: workers stay inside the cell
- **WHEN** a cell runs task-worker runtimes
- **THEN** every worker's state lives under that cell's data directory
- **AND** no worker of another cell is reachable from it

### Requirement: Cell state survives restarts and stays on local disk

A cell's data directory SHALL be the single root of its persistent state, addressed by an environment-provided path, so that stopping and starting a cell (same user, same data directory) restores that user's sessions, library, extensions, and scheduled jobs. A cell's SQLite databases SHALL reside on local (non-network-filesystem) storage.

#### Scenario: cell restart resumes state

- **WHEN** a user's cell process exits and is started again against the same data directory
- **THEN** the user's chat sessions resume from persisted history
- **AND** their document library, enabled MCP servers, custom skills, and cron jobs are restored

#### Scenario: no writable state outside the data directory

- **WHEN** a cell runs in hosted mode
- **THEN** every file it creates or modifies lives under its per-user data directory or per-user agent-home directory
- **AND** a fresh cell started with an empty data directory presents first-run state (no residue from other users or prior runs elsewhere)

### Requirement: Single-process modes preserve existing behavior

Running the platform server without the hosted-mode configuration SHALL preserve today's single-process behavior: one server, one dsh runtime, one data directory, optional auth, serving all connected clients. The packaged desktop app SHALL continue to run this way against its per-install data directory.

#### Scenario: dev mode unchanged

- **WHEN** the server is started without hosted-mode configuration
- **THEN** it serves all clients from one runtime and one data directory exactly as before this change

#### Scenario: desktop app unchanged

- **WHEN** the packaged desktop app starts
- **THEN** it runs its local server and dsh runtime against the install's user-data directory with its configured auth mode, independent of any cloud deployment
