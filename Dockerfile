# ── Full-stack single-container image for Platform ────────────────────────────
#
# Runs the backend (server.js) in ONE container via the supervisor
# (scripts/start.js → local-services.js → supervisor/lifecycle.js), exactly like
# `npm start` does locally. dsh's native plugins cover LLM routing and SaaS
# connectors, so there are no sidecar processes.
#
#   docker build -t harbor.local/paas_private/platform .
#   docker run -p 3000:3000 -v platform-data:/data harbor.local/paas_private/platform
#
# Multi-stage: the builder compiles native addons + builds web/dist; the runtime
# stage copies only what is needed. Node 25 is used in BOTH stages: the same major
# the release.yml CI uses, AND the lockfile was generated under npm 11 (Node 22's
# npm 10 misreads it — "Missing: zod@... from lock file"). The system Node ABI then
# matches the native addons compiled at `npm ci` time (better-sqlite3, tree-sitter).
#
# `npm run predist` is deliberately NOT run here. It builds resources/node — the
# standalone Node the *desktop* bundle needs — while the supervisor runs server.js
# on the system Node (process.execPath: this image's own Node), so nothing in the
# container would use it. It is also a 53 MB download from nodejs.org that stalls
# from the China build host.

# ── Base image ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A build arg because the two build hosts have opposite network access: the
# GitHub runner (docker-deploy.yml) reaches Docker Hub, while the China build
# host (Jenkins on cheap-3) cannot reach registry-1.docker.io at all and pulls
# the cluster's Harbor mirror instead — its Jenkinsfile passes that as
# BASE_IMAGE. Declared before the first FROM so both stages can use it.

# would throw "Cannot find module" before the PLATFORM_SKIP_* env guard can exit 0. We run

# dsh-matrix/ — the single version truth for the dsh runtime (ADR-0007,
# add-dsh-matrix-lock): intent pins in package.json, the full peer closure
# frozen in package-lock.json. The historical hand-pinned 28-row install
# (18 peer-only plugin rows, the two-generation sdk family split, the hmr
# 1.0.16 pin) lived here; the "why" now lives in dsh-matrix/README.md.

# One npm ci from the frozen matrix into /opt/dsh — the ONLY real tree (the
# old second install under /opt/dsh-home/profiles/platform is gone; that
# profile keeps its scaffold files and gets a node_modules SYMLINK here — the
# same seedHome pattern agent-runner/compose.js proves in staging, so the
# hundreds-of-MB dsh-base closure is never duplicated per home).
#
# .npmrc deliberately does NOT set legacy-peer-deps (it disabled transitive
# peer auto-installation and forced the old hand-pinned rows into existence);
# npm's default peer resolution fills the closure, and the lock freezes it.
# NO --legacy-peer-deps on this line either (design D3): under npm 11 (the npm
# node:25 ships) the flag makes npm ci SKIP every lock entry marked "peer":
# true — the 24-package dsh rc.2 plugin closure vanishes from /opt/dsh and the
# boot gate refuses to start (image-publish runs 37784214791 / 37836417702:
# "missing: @deepseek-ai/dsh-scope (lock: 0.1.1-rc.2) …"). The matrix tree is
# its own resolution universe — the overrides in dsh-matrix/package.json unify
# the rc.2/rc.5 generations — so npm's default peer resolution succeeds on the
# frozen lock; verified under npm 10.9 / 11.6 / 11.12 with diffMatrixTree
# (0 missing). The ROOT tree (above) is the opposite case: it declares both
# generations side by side, so its clean install is genuinely ERESOLVE and the
# flag is required there.
# NODE_OPTIONS heap bump: npm's resolver exhausts the default 2GB heap on
# this closure. Boot-time hard gate: server.js and agent-runner verify the
# installed tree against the same lock at startup (lib/dsh-matrix-verify.js).
