# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
# ── Full-stack single-container image for Platform ────────────────────────────
#
# Runs the backend (server.js) in ONE container via the supervisor
# (scripts/start.js → local-services.js → supervisor/lifecycle.js), exactly like
# `npm start` does locally. dsh's native plugins cover LLM routing and SaaS
# connectors, so there are no sidecar processes.
#
#   docker build -t harbor.local/paas_private/platform .
#   docker run -p 3000:3000 -v platform-data:/data harbor.local/paas_private/platform
#
# Multi-stage: the builder compiles native addons + builds web/dist; the runtime
# stage copies only what is needed. Node 25 is used in BOTH stages: the same major
# the release.yml CI uses, AND the lockfile was generated under npm 11 (Node 22's
# npm 10 misreads it — "Missing: zod@... from lock file"). The system Node ABI then
# matches the native addons compiled at `npm ci` time (better-sqlite3, tree-sitter).
#
# `npm run predist` is deliberately NOT run here. It builds resources/node — the
# standalone Node the *desktop* bundle needs — while the supervisor runs server.js
# on the system Node (process.execPath: this image's own Node), so nothing in the
# container would use it. It is also a 53 MB download from nodejs.org that stalls
# from the China build host.

# ── Base image ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A build arg because the two build hosts have opposite network access: the
# GitHub runner (docker-deploy.yml) reaches Docker Hub, while the China build
# host (Jenkins on cheap-3) cannot reach registry-1.docker.io at all and pulls
# the cluster's Harbor mirror instead — its Jenkinsfile passes that as
# BASE_IMAGE. Declared before the first FROM so both stages can use it.

# Bound every build-time Node process. The China build host (Jenkins on cheap-3)

# free memory makes the kernel OOM-kill kubelet and the node's registry/proxy —
# node NotReady, site 502 — which happened twice on 2026-09-21. A build that needs
# more than this cap fails HERE, which is recoverable, instead of taking the
# deployment down with it. (The web build peaks well under 1GB; measured.)

# Install root + web deps first (cacheable layer). --ignore-scripts skips the
# package.json postinstall hook (node scripts/postinstall-web.js && …postinstall-bundle.js):
# at this layer only package*.json is copied, so scripts/ doesn't exist yet and the hook
# would throw "Cannot find module" before the PLATFORM_SKIP_* env guard can exit 0. We run
# the web build + resource builds explicitly below, so the postinstall is redundant here —
# AND making it best-effort (postinstall-bundle.js never fails `npm install`) would mask a
# broken resource build that should fail the docker build.

# --omit=dev on the ROOT tree only: the runtime (scripts/start.js → server.js)
# never imports a devDependency, and they were ~330 MB of dead weight — the
# electron binary alone is 299 MB in what is a server-only image. The WEB ci
# below must keep devDeps: vite is one, and the image builds web/dist itself.
# Native addons (better-sqlite3/tree-sitter) ship prebuilt binaries, so
# --ignore-scripts + omit=dev compose safely.

# dsh-profile-template/ is consumed by the dsh install layer below (cp →
# /opt/dsh-home), so it must exist in the builder BEFORE that RUN. Copying it
# here keeps the slow dsh installs cacheable: these four tiny text files change
# far less often than the source that arrives via `COPY . .` further down.
COPY dsh-profile-template/ ./dsh-profile-template/

# dsh CLI (the agent runtime server.js spawns by name) + the JSON-RPC plugin
# profile scaffold comes from dsh-profile-template/ copied above. All
# pinned to the rcs the profiles were developed against — see ci(quality-gates)
# "pin dsh-base bundle version" for why rc tags must not float. These installs
# are SLOW and flaky on CI, so they run BEFORE `COPY . .`: source edits then
# never invalidate these layers. dsh-profile-template/ mirrors
# ~/.dsh/profiles/platform; the base bundle is pre-installed because the
# deployed runtime's network cannot reach npm. dsh-base must be 0.1.1-rc.2:
# 0.0.1-rc.1 pulls dsh-tool-bash → dsh-bash-env, which is not published (404);
# dsh-sdk-protocol is added because jsonrpc-server imports it undeclared
# (same reason ci.yml adds it). legacy-peer-deps mirrors ci.yml's pnpm
# profile (autoInstallPeers: false): jsonrpc-server@0.0.1-rc.5 sits on the
# 0.0.1 peer line (dsh-invariants ^0.0.1-rc.5) while dsh-base/protocol
# 0.1.1-rc.2 declare ^0.1.1-rc.2 — a mix pnpm tolerates and npm hard-fails
# with ERESOLVE (verified both ways locally before pushing).
#
# The explicit 0.1.1-rc.2 rows below exist because legacy-peer-deps disables
# peer auto-installation for TRANSITIVE packages too: dsh's tree declares them
# as peerDependencies only, so without them the runtime dies at boot with
# ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND (first seen as @deepseek-ai/dsh-sandbox from
# dsh-sandbox-policy). Enumerated by a peer-deps gap analysis over the
# installed tree; validated by booting `dsh --profile platform` and completing
# the sdk-client initialize handshake before this change was shipped.
# cordis-plugin-hmr is pinned deliberately (BOTH prefixes — dsh-base's transitive
# range floats to 1.0.17+ inside the profile tree otherwise): 1.0.17+ removed registerConfig,
# which dsh-app-boot's watchUserPatches calls unconditionally — a build that
# floats to >=1.0.17 crash-loops every dsh child at boot (2026-09-23 outage).
