## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Manifest validation and limits

The publish endpoint SHALL validate the manifest shape and reject invalid publishes with a machine-readable reason: skill entries SHALL have well-formed unique names and bounded content; MCP entries SHALL be registry-name references only (any endpoint URL or command config SHALL be rejected); agent entries SHALL be persona-only (any endpoint, model, or credential reference SHALL be rejected) and their ids SHALL NOT fall under the `user.` prefix (reserved for the cell's custom presets — openspec: custom-presets); an agent entry's resource declaration SHALL name only skills and MCP references that the same manifest declares, with no duplicated names within one declaration (violations SHALL be rejected naming the role and entry); the manifest as a whole SHALL stay within per-pack size and count limits. The cell's install path SHALL enforce the same rules on the manifest it receives.

#### Scenario: MCP entry with an endpoint URL is rejected

- **WHEN** a publish contains an MCP entry carrying a `url` or command config
- **THEN** the publish is rejected with a reason naming the offending entry

#### Scenario: Agent entry with an endpoint is rejected

- **WHEN** a publish contains an agent entry carrying `baseUrl`, `model`, or `apiKeyEnv`
- **THEN** the publish is rejected with a reason naming the offending entry

#### Scenario: Oversized skill is rejected

- **WHEN** a publish contains a skill body exceeding the per-skill content limit
- **THEN** the publish is rejected with a reason naming the offending skill

#### Scenario: Role declaration naming an undeclared resource is rejected

- **WHEN** a publish contains an agent entry whose resource declaration names a skill or MCP reference not present in the manifest's own lists
- **THEN** the publish is rejected with a reason naming the role and the unknown name

#### Scenario: Duplicated declaration entry is rejected

- **WHEN** a role's resource declaration lists the same skill or MCP name twice
- **THEN** the publish is rejected with a reason naming the role and the duplicate

#### Scenario: Reserved-prefix agent id is rejected

- **WHEN** a publish contains an agent entry whose id starts with `user.`
- **THEN** the publish is rejected with a reason naming the entry and the reserved namespace
