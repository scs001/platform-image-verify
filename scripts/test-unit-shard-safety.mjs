// ── Why this suite must NOT use `--test-shard` ───────────────────────────────
//
// The unit suite is slow (~63 min on a cold 2-core runner, run 42630983629).
// The obvious fix is `node --test --test-shard=N/M`, and it LOOKS right: with
// two files, shard 1/2 ran only one file's cases. It is not right.
//
// Measured 2026-11-09 with four files and `--test-reporter=tap`: shard 1/2
// executed cases from THREE of them — `--test-shard` partitions the FLATTENED
// test list, not the file list. One file's cases therefore land on different
// runners and run CONCURRENTLY, which is exactly what `--test-concurrency=1`
// exists to prevent (within-file ordering is load-bearing: queue-health's
// "a record left queued on disk does not leak" only means anything because the
// earlier cases in that file ran first).
//
// This test pins the constraint so the next person who reaches for the flag
// finds the reason instead of a green CI that hides a lost invariant.
